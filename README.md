# Upgradeable MSOT (ERC20 Token)

## Introduction

This project includes the following:

- [x] Upgradeable contracts - Implemented through UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern (OpenZeppelin Standard)

- [x] MSOT (ERC20 Token)

- [x] Scripts for deployment and upgradation of the smart contract

- [x] Unit and Integration Tests

## Project Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
    
1. Clone the repo

2. Run `npm install` in the root of the repo

3. Add a `secret.json` file in your root directory, where you'll store your wallet address, key and other sensitive data. The content should be similar to this: 

    ```
    {
        "key": "<Key to your metamask wallet account>",
        "MSOT_PROJECT_RINKEBY": "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<MSOT-Project-Id>",
        "wallet_address": "<Your metamask account address>",
        "deployedMsotAddress": "<Once you deploy MSOT, it will return an address, paste that here>"
    }
    ```
   > **Please Note:**  Deployed address is required because it is needed in upgradation, after the initial deployment. This file needs to be kept private.
   

4. Run `npx hardhat compile` to get all the contracts compiled

5. Run `npx hardhat test` to run all the tests

6. Run `npx hardhat coverage` to know the testing coverage

7. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/<script-name>.js` to run any of the scripts

8. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/<script-name>.js --network rinkeby` to make transactions like, deployment and upgradation on the testnet. Try running these scripts, but do remember that your rinkeby configuration in hardhat.config.js file will look like this: 

    ```
    rinkeby: {
        url: secret.MSOT_PROJECT_RINKEBY, 
        accounts: [secret.key] 
    }
    ```

    `npx hardhat run scripts/DeployMsotProxy.js --network rinkeby`

   It should deploy the contract on the rinkeby testnet and return the address, paste that address in the deployedMsotAddress in your secret.json file so that you can upgrade it later on.

    `npx hardhat run scripts/UpgradeMsotProxy.js --network rinkeby`



9. To verify your smart proxy contract visit `https://etherscan.io/proxyContractChecker` enter your proxy address to verify, If main contract is not verified you need to verify using make command.


10. To verify smart main contract,please your contract main address and then  run command depending on your network `Make verify-mainnet-contract`, now go back and run reverify `https://etherscan.io/proxyContractChecker` this time your contract will be verified.
